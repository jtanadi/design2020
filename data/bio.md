My name is Jesen Tanadi and I'm a designer-turned-developer in New York City.

I've written a number of design-related tools in JavaScript and Python and contributed to OSS, specifically in the field of type design. Recently, I decided to formalize my software engineering training and attended (graduated from!) [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/).

I am currently looking for full stack or front end engineering position, preferably in New York City. I have experience writing JavaScript and Python, and have some understanding of TypeScript, C, and Java. My tech stack includes: Node, express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and flask. If you have a lead or just want to chat, you can contact my through [e-mail](mailto:mail@jesentanadi.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jesentanadi), [GitHub](https://github.com/jtanadi), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesentanadi).

My machine runs the [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/) Linux distribution, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator, [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) + [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and [neovim](https://neovim.io/). This website was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), written in TypeScript, and deployed on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/); the source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jtanadi/web2020).

My name is Jesen Tanadi and I'm a designer and full stack developer currently working on museums, design tools, and open source software. I have a background in architecture graphic design, and experience working on complex design systems for a wide range of experiences as well as the tooling needed to help designers achieve that goal.

I'm always interested in hearing about a designer/developer hybrid role. I'm fluent in JavaScript, proficient in TypeScript and the JS/TS web ecosystem (Node, express, React/Redux), and love Neovim. If you'd like to chat, you can contact me through [e-mail](mailto:mail@jesentanadi.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jesentanadi), [GitHub](https://github.com/jtanadi), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesentanadi).

This website was written in TypeScript, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), and deployed on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/). The source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jtanadi/web2020).

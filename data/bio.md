My name is Jesen Tanadi and I'm a developer with a background in design and architecture.

I'm currently looking for full stack or front end engineering position, preferably in New York City. I have experience writing JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python, and have some understanding of C and Java. If you'd like to chat, you can contact my through [e-mail](mailto:mail@jesentanadi.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jesentanadi), [GitHub](https://github.com/jtanadi), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jesentanadi).

My current tech stack includes: Node, express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and flask. I run the [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/) Linux distribution, [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator with [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/), and write in [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

This website was written in TypeScript, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx), and deployed on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/). The source code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jtanadi/web2020).
